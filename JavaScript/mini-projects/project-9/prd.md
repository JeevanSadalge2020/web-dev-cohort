# Objective

- The BG should change when we click button
  - If its black already, then should become light
  - If light already, then should become dark

# Plan

- We can define 2 classed. One for dark and another for light
- On button change, the classed will change no matter what it is currently
- Also we do need to change the button text, i.e. for light BG, the button text should say 'dark' and for dark BG, the button text should have a text of 'light'
